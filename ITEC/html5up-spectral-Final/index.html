                        <p style="text-align:left">On April 10, Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), David Perdue (R-NC), and Josh
                            Hawley (R-MO) reintroduced the RAISE Act (S.1103, the Reforming American
                            Immigration for Strong Employment Act), thie is a legislation that would:<br><br>
                            1. Slash family-based visas. All family-based legal immigration other than spouses and minor children will be eliminated.
                            <br><br>
                            2. Introduce a merit-based points system. Visas will be approved or denied based on factors including English ability, advanced education, age and specific job skills. A person who accrued 30 points under
                            the following allocation scheme would be eligible to submit an application.
                            <br><br>
                            3. Reduce refugee visas. The bill proposes a 50,000-visa cap, despite the ever-worsening global refugee crisis.
                            <br><br>
                            4. Eliminate the Diversity Visa Program. This will cut 50,000 annual visas for individuals from historically low-immigration countries, primarily in Africa and Asia.

                    <h2>Situation of immigrants</h2>
                    <p>In many states, the income of immigrant families is not very different
                        from that of non-immigrant families, though some individual earning is
                        lower. This is because there are typically more workers per immigrant family.
                        Although most immigrants are not poor, nationally 20 percent live below
                        the poverty line, compared with 16 percent of native-born citizens. In
                        2017, there were 27.4 million children under age 18 living in low-income
                        families (i.e., with family incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty
                        threshold). Of them, 8.8 million (or 32 percent) were children of immigrants.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Thirty-nine percent of immigrant workers are less likely to work in office

                        in management while 113 percent more are likely to work in construction.
                        There are as many immigrants in white-collar jobs as in other occupations.
                        In some state, over half of immigrants are in white-collar jobs. However,
                        not all white-collar jobs are pay well. .&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Family Separation</h3>
                    <p>Firstly, the number of separated children in the USA should be examined. 
                        Although there are insufficient data on the Internet to show us the numbers 
                        of separated children in all the US states, we are still able to investigate
                         the problem from the data that we could obtain. In the graph below, we can see 
                         that the southern part of the USA has more separated children than that in 
                         the other states, especially in Texas.
                         <br><br>
                         As the southern part of the USA contains a lot of immigrates from Mexico or 
                         some African countries, and a number of them are low-incomed, we can see that 
                         the number of separated children is related to the immigration problem and the 
                         income level. Children separating from families means they will become orphans 
                        and unable to receive a completed childhood, and effecting their future development.
                    <br></br>
                The RAISE Act, which stops U.S. citizens from sponsoring their children and siblings into the U.S. would only increases the number of childeren and family being seperated. </p>

                        <h3 style="float: left;">Jobs and Economic Growth</h3><br><br><br>
            <p>Secondly, the impact on jobs and economic growth. The figure below shows a sharp decline in legal immigration after the enactment of RAISE Act. As the number of immigrantion decreases rapidly, it also reduces employment because the domestic worker participation rate won’t increase enough to fill the jobs that would have been held by immigrants who are no longer allowed in the country. <br><br>It is predicted that in its first year, under the RAISE Act, the U.S. project 92,537 fewer jobs. After 10 years, job losses increase to 1.3 million relative to current law. By 2040, 4.6 million jobs are lost. The RAISE Act would reduce the number immigrants per year while increasing the portion of new immigrants that are highly skilled. <br><br>We project that the RAISE Act will lead to less economic growth and fewer jobs than otherwise. Job losses emerge because domestic workers will not fill all the jobs that immigrant workers would have filled. While in the short run the RAISE Act leads to a small boost to per capita GDP, in the long run per capita GDP dips slightly. Gains in average wages are positive but small.

            <p>Thirdly, decreasing family based immigrants meanwhile increasing the portion of professional immigrants could ease the financial burden of the U.S. government. <br><br>In 1965, the USA passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which greatly 
                increased the total number of the immigrants moving into the USA, especially from 
                Asia and Africa.</br>
                <br>
                From the graph below, we can see that the healthcare expenditure had significantly 
                increased after the year of 1965, and even had increased five times in compare to 
                nowadays. This can easily be read as the immigrants increased the burden of the 
                government, and people might start to label or even discriminate the immigrants 
                as sponger to the USA. This could make the immigrants felt uncomfortable or even 
                difficult to blend in with society. The RAISE Act could decrease the government healthcare expenditure to some extent by decreasing the total number of family-based immigrants whom are the major dependency of low cost healthcare services.
